1. Code Structure
Summary: Always make sure to use semicolons at the end of statements. Sometimes javascript can intepret multiple statements as single statement and may produce error

2. "use strict"
Summary: In 2009 the introduction of ES5, introduced new features and modified some old features. In order to keep the old code running as it was, the new changes were disabled by default. The user needs to enable them explicitly to use them, by using the string "use strict" at the top of the script file.

3. Data Types
Eight data types in javascript, 7 primitive and 1 non-primitive(object):
i) Number : represents int, float
ii) BigInt : represents number of arbitrary length. Ends with 'n'.
iii) String: sequence of characters, can be empty.
iv) Boolean : True/False
v) null : represents a value which is unknown, empty, nothing.
vi) undefined : represents a "value is not assigned". Serves as a default/initial value to variables
vii) Symbols : defines unique indentfiers to objects
viii) Object : represents complex data structures
typeof : typeof(null) //object (Error in language)
typeof function(){} == "function" // functions are treated specially

4. alert, prompt, confirm
prompt : gives a text to user and input field to enter text, if cancel is clicked "null" is returned
cofirm : OK returns True, cancel returns False

5. Type Conversions
i) String : String(value)
ii) Number : Number(value). Mathematical operations convert values to numbers. Rules:
alert( "6" / "2" ); // 3, strings are converted to numbers
Number(undefined) -> NaN
Number(null) -> 0
Number(true/false) -> 1/0
Number(string) -> "123" = 123, "abc" = NaN, "" = 0
iii) Boolean : Boolean(value)
Boolean(0/null/undefined/NaN/"") -> false
Boolean(any other value) -> true

6. Concatenation
Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.
alert(1 + '2') //12
alert(2 + 2 + '1' ); // "41" and not "221"
alert('1' + 2 + 2); // "122" and not "14"
+ is the only operator that works this way, other operators always convert operands to numbers
alert( 6 - '2' ); // 4, converts '2' to a number
alert( '6' / '2' ); // 3, converts both operands to numbers

7. Just read Comparison chapter again in free time. 
When comparing values of different types, JavaScript converts the values to numbers.
== -> does not check the date type. Performs type conversion to Number
alert( 0 == false ); // true
alert( '' == false ); // true
=== -> checks the data type. No type conversions. Returns false if type are not equal
The values null and undefined equal == each other and do not equal any other value.

8. Logical operator
|| -> returns the first thruthy value, otherwise the last operand.
&& -> returns the first falsey value, otherwise the last operand.
?? -> returns the fist argument if its not null/undefined, otherwise the second operand
result = a ?? b; equivalent to result = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;

9. function
A function with empty return or without return statement, returns undefined
function doNothing() { /* empty */ }
alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true
function doNothing() {return;}
alert( doNothing() === undefined ); // true
Callback function: functions are passed as arguments of another function and are expected to be called back later on.
Arrow function: 
let fun = (a,b) => a + b;
let fun = function(a,b) {
    return (a + b);
}
If there is only one argument parenthesis can be omitted.
If there are no arguments, parenthesis is empty but must be present.
If the expression at the right side of => is complex, we enclose it in {}, in such an explicit return must be written.
let sum = (a, b) => {  // the curly brace opens a multiline function
  let result = a + b;
  return result; // if we use curly braces, then we need an explicit "return"
};
